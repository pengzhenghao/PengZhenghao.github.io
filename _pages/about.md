Hi there! I am an incoming PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles, supervised by [Professor Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io).
I earned my MPhil degree at Chinese University of Hong Kong and Bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
My research interests cover multi-agent RL (for potential usage in open-world games) and human-AI interaction (like playing with AI). 
This is my academic homepage and hope you enjoy my works!
