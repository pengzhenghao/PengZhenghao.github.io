Hi there! I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, and will be supervised by [Professor Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io).
Before moving to UCLA, I already worked with Prof. Zhou and conducted researches for years and earned my MPhil degree at Chinese University of Hong Kong. I got my Bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 


My research interests cover multi-agent RL (for potential usage in open-world games) and human-AI interaction (like playing with AI). 
Hope you enjoy my works!

**I am looking for summer internship in 2023!**
