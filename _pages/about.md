Hi there! I am a graduate student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Professor Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io).
My research interests cover multi-agent RL (for potential usage in open-world games) and human-AI interaction (like playing with AI). 
This is my academic homepage and hope you enjoy my works!
