**TLDR: John-How Pong**

Peng (彭) is my family name. It is hard to pronounce in English. 
Most people pronounce like *Pain* which is far from it should be like.
The most similar analogies are *Pong* or *Pung*. 

Zhenghao (正皓) is my given name with two Chinese characters.
It sounds very similar to *John-How*. 
Please don't omit any English character in the pinyin and make it become *Zhengao* or *Zhenhao*.

I prefer to put family name in the first place following Chinese convention.
But it's OK to follow some rules in paper writing, email and networking to avoid confusion.
